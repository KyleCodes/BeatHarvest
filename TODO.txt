- remove ssh dir + logic if no longer needed
- include playlists that have xdj in the playlist description

[WEB UI]
- explicitly list all of user's playlists
  - allow user to specify which playlists they would like to add to download list
  - either local file stores this, or we mutate the playlist description to contain "xdj"
      - local file likely better for this.
